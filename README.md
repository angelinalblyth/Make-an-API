# Make an API

Make an API of your choosing. Make sure your API supports the the four CRUD actions:

- CREATE
- READ
- UPDATE
- DELETE

Your API can be on any subject you like, for example, you might choose to manage films, books, employees, users... use an array of strings as your data source for now.

Test your routes using Insomnia.

# Extensions

- Add a related, second controller to your API. Refactor your app appropriately.
- Rather than using an array of `String`s as your data source, use an array of objects instead.
